# üé¨ Ganflix ‚Äì Personal Streaming Application

### ‚ú® Introduction

Ganflix wasn't originally meant to be part of my public portfolio‚Äîit started out as a deeply personal project, something built entirely for my own use. Over time, however, it became a fully functional, modern streaming platform that I now use regularly across my local devices.

Built with a clean and modern UI tailored to my own aesthetic preferences, Ganflix serves as my personal entertainment hub. I use it to stream movies and TV series stored on a dedicated external hard drive, while also managing watchlists, tracking progress, and even taking notes on content I've viewed. It's become a go-to tool for watching content with friends and family‚Äîsomething they‚Äôve all enjoyed using too.

I‚Äôve decided to share this project not only to demonstrate my technical proficiency but also to showcase a real-world, personal-use application that I‚Äôve developed from scratch and genuinely use.

### üé´ Things to consider

Ganflix is a personal-use project and is not designed for commercial or public streaming. The media it presents is locally stored on an external hard disk, and the app accesses that storage directly‚Äîno external video sources are used.

That said, the app is fully operational within that scope and currently includes:

- ‚úÖ A modern, responsive UI tailored for desktop use
- ‚úÖ Local video playback for both movies and series
- ‚úÖ Functional watchlists and status tracking
- ‚úÖ A note-taking feature per content item
- ‚úÖ Smooth navigation and performance within the Electron desktop environment

> Note: Since Ganflix was never intended for public use, the backend code is not available in its original TypeScript format. Instead, I currently have access to the JavaScript build version, which might not be as intuitive to read through at first. However, it still provides insight into how the backend was developed and functions to support the application.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Ganflix is developed using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, both based on TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainable code. The application is wrapped and deployed as a desktop application via Electron, allowing seamless integration with local file systems and providing an intuitive app-like experience on any desktop machine.

The app is uniquely integrated into an external hard disk, which allows me to easily share and plug it into my local machines for consistent access to the content and the platform. This setup ensures a portable and reliable experience wherever I need it, and it fully supports local video storage and playback.

### üëÄ Sneak Peek

The UI of Ganflix is designed to be modern, clean, and intuitive, tailored to my personal taste while ensuring ease of use. The layout focuses on simplicity and clarity, making it easy to browse through movies and TV series, view details, and manage watchlists. The design incorporates vibrant colors, setting a cinema theater theme that makes the content pop and enhances the visual experience. With smooth animations and transitions, the app provides an enjoyable and seamless experience whether you're watching solo or with friends and family. The color scheme, typography, and overall design reflect a contemporary look, prioritizing functionality while making the content even more appealing.
